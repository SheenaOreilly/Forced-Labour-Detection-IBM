# Forced-Labour-Detection-IBM

IBM, Trinity College Dublin, Computer Science, Software Engineering Project.

Objective:
Use IBM Watson AI Platform to create a NLP based model (Natural Language Processing) that can help identify the high risk online job advertisements based on a risk score algorithm that includes factors such as job type, source & destination locations, specific terms & conditions and industry sectors. The output from this model will be used to generate a community network identifying the common identifiers/attributes in the job ads for investigative analysis.
